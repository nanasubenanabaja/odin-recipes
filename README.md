This project consists of a Modest website containing tasty recipes.

By completing this project, I will demonstrate a few basic HTML skills, such as: making a web page's basic boilerplate, organizing files properly into folders, linking between web pages, and inserting images.

Recipes will be taken from Rosita Cocina's YouTube channel. I enjoy her channel a lot!
