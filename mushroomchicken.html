        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup tomato paste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
            <li>2 cups common mushroom</li>
            <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>2 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
            <li>6 tbsp oil</li>
            <li>1 previously marinated chicken, separated into pieces</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate your chicken. Marinating it for about three hours should be enough, but for Maximum Flavor, you can leave it marinating overnight.</li>
            <li>Pour the oil in a deep skillet and brown the chicken. Closing it with a lid will help brown the chicken faster.</li>
            <li>Make sure to brown all sides. Check the chicken periodically.</li>
            <li>Heat the butter in a pan, and once it's melted, fry the mushrooms for 3-5 minutes. They will shrink a little, so you'll have to be careful with the timing.</li>
            <li>Mix the tomato paste, the wine, the chicken stock and the flour in a bowl, with the help of a whisk. Make sure there are no lumps left.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture over the chicken and add the bay leaf for extra flavor. Let it cook until the sauce boils.</li>
            <li>Add the mushrooms and mix everything evenly.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!!</li>
