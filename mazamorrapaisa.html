        <p><em>Mazamorra</em> is a traditional Latin American dish. Different iterations can be found throughout South America (and Spain), but the basic ingredients remain the same: Milk and maize.</p>
        <p>This particular iteration comes from the northern part of Colombia, widely known as the Coffee Zone. Locally, people from this area, and their customs and culture are called "paisa".</p>
        <p>This is a great dish for cold weather and fortunately, it can be found in various cities of Colombia.</p>
        <p>This recipe was taken and translated from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0Fnh7zBkNQ">Rosita Cocina's</a> YouTube channel.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound threshed white maize</li>
            <li>1 pound yellow maize</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>water</li>
            <li>Guava paste or panela (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the maize (both kinds, separately) overnight. </li>
            <li>Cook the white maize in a pressure cooker for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Grind the yellow maize with a grain milling machine. At this stage, the maize should be ground into flakes.</li>
            <li>Wash the ground maize 3 times. Use a strainer to do this. Don't dispose of the water or the residue -- reuse it. We're trying to get corn starch so we can thicken our mazamorra later on. </li>
            <li>Wash the maize flakes until they're clean, then grind again. Adjust the milling machine so this time the maize is finely ground.</li>
            <li>Cook the ground maize with 8 cups of water for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the water you used to wash the maize previously. Note that the water must NOT have any starch left over. Let it cook for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the white maize to the mix and let it cook for another 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the baking soda.</li>
            <li>Add the corn starch.</li>
            <li>Let everything boil until the mazamorra thickens. Mix everything together with the help of a wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>If the mazamorra is too thick, you can add some boiling water. It's important that the water is hot when you add it!</li>
            <li>When you serve the mazamorra, fill half the bowl with the maize mixture, and add milk.</li>
            <li>You can sweeten this dish with some panela or guava paste, but if you cannot get any of these ingredients, brown sugar is a good substitute.</li>
        </ol>
